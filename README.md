# ESP32-C3_Sungrow_S100_Monitor
This project provides PlatformIO code for building a custom Wi-Fi enabled monitoring device for Sungrow S100 energy meters. It collects all available metrics through the meter's RS485/MODBUS interface and sends them to InfluxDB v2 or MQTT.
The solution works alongside the inverter that the S100 is typically connected to - it unobtrusively monitors communications while the inverter is running, and takes over in requesting/reporting metrics if the inverter is offline (e.g. during the night).

### Required Hardware
- An ESP32-C3 SuperMini board. They're small, cheap and well suited to this project.

- A TTL to RS485 adaptor, many of which are available on eBay and Aliexpress. I recommend the type depicted below as they have built-in level shifting, flow control and transient protection.

- A 2-way Ethernet splitter, allowing the S100 to connect to both the inverter and the RS485 adaptor.

- An old Ethernet cable you're willing to sacrifice. This will plug into the Meter/DRM RJ45 jack on the inverter and S100 via the Ethernet splitter.
- A short Ethernet cable to connect the Ethernet splitter to the inverter.
